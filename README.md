dotfiles
========
This is my repository for configuration files related to unix. My setup.sh
script is a fairly basic one which will backup current instances of .bashrc,
.inputrc, and .vimrc in your folder folder then link the configuration files in
this repository to the corresponding file in your home folder. This includes
.vim which contains my vim plugins and colorschemes.
